              I participated in and completed the Diploma in Teaching English as
              a Second Language conducted by the National Institute of
              Education, Sri Lanka, during the academic year 2009/2010. This was
              a one-year, full-time program, during which I received study
              leave. Prior to this, I had completed my training as an internal
              student at the Training College in Maharagama.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
              The diploma program provided a comprehensive curriculum that
              included the following subjects:
            </p>
            <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
              <li>Linguistics and the Structure of English</li>
              <li>Sociolinguistics and Psycholinguistics</li>
              <li>Methodology of Teaching English as a Second Language</li>
              <li>Educational Technology</li>
              <li>Small-Scale Research Methods</li>
              <li>Methods of Teacher Education and Supervision</li>
              <li>Language Testing and Evaluation</li>
              <li>Teaching Literature for O/L Students</li>
              <li>Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL)</li>
              <li>Practice Teaching and Internship</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pt-4">
              This intensive program deepened my understanding of English
              language teaching, with a focus on theoretical frameworks,
              practical methodologies, and the integration of technology in
              education. The experience also enhanced my ability to design
              effective lesson plans, assess student progress, and conduct
              research to improve teaching practices.

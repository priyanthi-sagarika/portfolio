              I was selected to follow the Teaching English for Specific
              Academic Purposes (ESAP) course conducted by the Department of
              Languages, University of Moratuwa. This program consisted of four

                <strong>Teaching Practicum</strong>
                <p>
                  As part of this module, I had the valuable opportunity to
                  teach students at the University of Moratuwa. This hands-on
                  experience allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge
                  gained during the course in a real academic environment,
                  refine my teaching techniques, and interact with students in a
                  university setting.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pt-4">
              The Teaching English for Specific Academic Purposes course was an
              enriching experience that profoundly impacted my professional
              growth. The program equipped me with the skills to conduct
              effective needs analyses, design lessons tailored to adult
              learners, and employ innovative teaching methodologies such as
              task-based and communicative language teaching.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              The practicum was particularly transformative, as it provided a
              platform to implement strategies for teaching grammar, vocabulary,
              and the four language skills in a structured and supportive
              academic environment. Working with university students enabled me
              to understand their unique challenges and aspirations, which has
              helped me become more empathetic and resourceful as an educator.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of
              adaptability, continuous learning, and fostering an engaging
              classroom atmosphere to meet the diverse needs of adult learners
              in academic settings. I was appointed to a post of visiting
              instructor in English in the Department of Languages, University
              of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka for the academic year 2018. This was one of
              the turning points in my journey of lifelong education.

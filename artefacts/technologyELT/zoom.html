              At the beginning, I felt intimidated by the technical aspects of
              using Zoom. Managing features such as screen sharing, breakout
              rooms, and chat functions felt overwhelming at first. I also felt
              frustrated when some students could not join due to a lack of
              devices or poor internet connectivity. Despite these challenges, I
              appreciated the platform’s potential to bring us together during
              such a disruptive time, and I felt proud when I started mastering
              its features.

              Using Zoom had both positive and negative aspects. On the positive
              side, it allowed real-time interaction, enabling me to maintain a
              connection with my students. Features like screen sharing and
              annotation helped make lessons more dynamic. On the negative side,
              poor internet connections disrupted lessons frequently, and some
              students were left out entirely due to lack of access. Keeping
              students engaged was another challenge, as the virtual environment
              often felt impersonal.

            <p class="pt-4">
              The experience highlighted the importance of understanding and
              utilizing digital tools effectively. I realized that Zoom could be
              a powerful teaching platform when used creatively, but it required
              significant preparation. For example, I started using polls and
              breakout rooms to encourage participation, which improved
              engagement. However, the inequity in access to devices and stable
              internet was a major barrier, showing the digital divide’s impact
              on education.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              While teaching via Zoom was challenging, it was also an
              opportunity for growth. I became more confident in using
              technology and learned strategies to make online lessons more
              interactive. However, the experience also underscored the
              importance of addressing access issues to ensure no student is
              left behind.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              In the future, I plan to further explore Zoom’s features to
              enhance engagement, such as using virtual whiteboards and
              integrating third-party tools for collaboration. I will also
              ensure lessons are recorded and shared for students who cannot
              join live sessions. Additionally, I will advocate for policies
              that improve access to devices and internet for all students,
              making digital learning more inclusive.

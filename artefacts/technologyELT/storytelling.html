              I felt unsure about incorporating digital storytelling into my
              teaching initially. While I understood the basic concept, using it
              as an educational tool required significant planning and
              creativity. Creating engaging digital stories and teaching
              students how to participate in the process felt overwhelming at
              first. I was also concerned about whether students had the
              necessary technical skills and resources to engage effectively.
              However, I quickly realized the potential of this tool to
              captivate students and make learning more meaningful.

              Using digital storytelling had both positive and negative aspects.
              On the positive side, it allowed me to present lessons in a way
              that was visually and emotionally engaging. Integrating images,
              videos, voiceovers, and music made the learning process more
              interactive and memorable. Students were able to connect with the
              content on a deeper level, and many enjoyed creating their own
              stories, which gave them a sense of ownership and creativity. On
              the negative side, it required considerable time to prepare and
              guide students through the technical process. Additionally, some
              students faced challenges due to limited access to devices or
              unfamiliarity with the necessary tools.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              The experience highlighted the importance of integrating creative
              approaches into teaching. Digital storytelling proved to be a
              powerful method for enhancing engagement and encouraging critical
              thinking. It helped students understand complex topics by
              presenting them in a relatable and visually appealing way. I also
              learned to scaffold the process for students, breaking it into
              manageable steps and providing clear instructions to ensure they
              could participate fully.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              While using digital storytelling was challenging, it also allowed
              me to discover new ways of connecting with students. I witnessed
              their enthusiasm as they explored their creative potential and
              developed skills in multimedia creation. The process reinforced
              the importance of fostering creativity and adaptability in
              teaching.
            </p>
            <p class="pt-4">
              I plan to use digital storytelling more frequently as a tool for
              both teaching and assessment. I will continue to explore
              user-friendly tools and applications that make the process more
              accessible for students. Additionally, I will design projects that
              balance creativity with achievable outcomes, ensuring that all
              students, regardless of their technical skills or resources, can
              participate meaningfully. By advocating for better access to
              digital tools and providing training, I hope to make digital
              storytelling a sustainable and impactful part of my teaching
              practice.

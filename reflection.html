            The lesson was conducted in a highly motivating and impressive
            teaching learning environment. Although the lesson was grounded in
            Pupils' text book, grade 11 to improve their reading competence, It
            was appropriately Supported by modern technology, a digital story,
            practicing tasks and recording. The lesson smoothly flowed within.
            the given period of time through the well organized stages. present,
            Practice and Production. The content was very inspiring since the
            setting of the story was placed in war time era in Hitler's regime.
            The piece of horrible war was felt by the adolescents' inquisitive,
            logical and empathetic mindset according to Piaget, the educational
            Psychologist. Further the text is an eye opener to the adult world,
            informing the unwavering courage of youth confronting a tragedy The
            class of students well managed by the teacher personality right
            through with her appropriate dress code gestures, eye contact, a
            good rapport and positions to maintain order, individual attention,
            giving instructions and grouped, paired monitoring activities that
            are performed in and individual manner. The effort of improving
            macro and micro skills of reading skills was ultimately and
            evidently Successful as mentioned in the short, motivating,
            achievable the time framed objectives. the on-going Assessment
            process ended up giving a constructive Feedback on performances. The
            instructor was flexible hence witnessed a smooth flow and minute
            learners' behavioral changes towards Success. I wish her good luck.

              I felt proud and satisfied with how the students connected deeply
              with the lesson. Their emotional and intellectual engagement was
              rewarding. However, I was also concerned about ensuring that all
              students had equal opportunities to participate, as some required
              more guidance during group activities. This feeling highlighted
              the challenge of balancing the needs of all learners within the
              limited time frame.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the experience had many positive aspects. The use of
              technology and the thought-provoking story successfully engaged
              the students and improved their four skills. The class was
              well-managed, and the objectives were achieved within the time
              frame. However, some students' varying levels of ability presented
              a challenge, as not all were equally prepared or confident in
              group activities. This difference in readiness slightly impacted
              the lesson's flow for certain students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on the situation, I realized that while the lesson
              structure and content were effective, more attention could have
              been given to differentiated instruction. Some students needed
              more tailored support to fully engage with the tasks, and
              providing additional scaffolding would have ensured a more
              inclusive learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I were to conduct this lesson again, I would focus on
              pre-lesson preparation. Providing students with preparatory
              materials or instructions beforehand could help bridge the gap in
              readiness. I would also integrate differentiated activities to
              cater to individual learning needs, ensuring that all students can
              participate meaningfully.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, I would also advocate for greater flexibility in
              resources. Given the restrictions in Sri Lankan schools, allowing
              students to bring their devices with proper permissions could
              enhance lesson plans and make activities more accessible. This
              approach would not only improve engagement but also help develop
              students' ICT skills alongside their competence. As a teacher who
              tries to bring variety to the classroom, I am not demotivated by
              the challenges I faced but will try my best to achieve my
              objectives in the teaching and learning process.

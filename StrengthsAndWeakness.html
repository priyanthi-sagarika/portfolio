              As a teacher with nearly 30 years of experience, I have honed my
              ability to create a positive and inclusive learning environment
              while overcoming numerous challenges within the education system.
              My strengths lie in fostering student engagement, tailoring
              lessons to diverse needs, and building strong student-teacher
              relationships.

              At the same time, I have faced structural and systemic limitations

              rewarding and challenging aspects of the teaching profession.

                    Differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all learners.
                    Most of the time, my classrooms consist of mixed-ability
                    groups, and I firmly believe that every student has the
                    potential to learn and succeed, even though they all have
                    different learning styles and needs.

                    <br />
                    Therefore, I always assess the abilities, needs, and levels
                    of my students to create lessons tailored to their learning
                    styles and interests.

                    I also provide students with different opportunities to
                    apply what they have learned in real-life situations. This
                    approach has helped me create a classroom environment where
                    every student feels supported and engaged in their learning

                    I often have to work within strict guidelines set by my
                    school. These rules can restrict my freedom to make
                    decisions about how to teach. I have faced some challenging
                    experiences incorporating group work and pair work in my
                    classroom, where I have to create learning experiences with
                    minimal facilities available.

                    In the Sri Lankan context, there are significant disparities
                    in the resources provided to schools. Many schools lack
                    basic facilities, teaching materials, technological devices,
                    and trained staff to employ modernized and engaging teaching
                    styles. This hinders the quality of education that students
                    receive and perpetuates cycles of disadvantage within
                    communities.

                    Fixed curricula that teachers must follow, traditional
                    textbooks written by inexperienced authors, a lack of
                    facilities, administrative requirements, and education
                    policies can limit teachers' flexibility to address diverse
                    learning styles, varying needs, and differing abilities and
                    backgrounds of students that require a personalized
                    approach. All these challenges significantly affect how
                    effective teachers can be in their roles. The implication is
                    that for teachers to perform well, they need more support
                    and freedom.
